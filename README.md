# ascii-art

This project contains a script, "main.py", to convert an image into ASCII art like the image below.
To use it, just write in the terminal "python main.py \<image directory\>" like "python main.py image_examples/phineas.jpg" in this project directory.
    
Unlike other projects that used 15 characters at maximum to represent all tones, with this project I represent the images with all ASCII characters and instead of eyeballing the 'brightness' of each character I calculated the 'brightness' of each of them by calculating the average value of the pixels of an image representing each character. I have the script that I used to make this in the jupyter notebook 'research.ipynb'.

For this project what I did was:

1. I wrote a script in the jupyter notebook 'research.ipynb' to automate the process of converting all the ASCII characterS into images using a website that did this conversion, 'https://onlineasciitools.com/convert-ascii-to-image'.
2. Then I calculate the 'brightness' of each character by calculating the average value of each of their pixels and because the values were between 0 and 255 I normalized them to be between 0 and 1 where 0 represented black and 1 white.
3. Than to convert an image into ASCII art I just resized the image into a reasonable size for ASCII art and then replaced each pixel by a character that represented best the tone of that pixel and the result was the above.
